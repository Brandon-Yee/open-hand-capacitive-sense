# Open Hand Capacitive Sensing ROS

## Overview
The purpose of this package is to manage the sensor integration through ROS. AprilTags are used as the ground truth pose representation of the robot finger. ROS is used to synchronize pose measurements to the capacitive values from the TI FDC2214 capacitive sensing chip.
