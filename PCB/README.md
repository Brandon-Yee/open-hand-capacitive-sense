# PCB files for the capacitive electrode used in the finger joint

## Electrode
The PCE electrode contains a circular ground plane on one layer. The other layer
 has two semi-circular regions acting as electrode surfaces for capacitive senso
rs with the FDC2214 chip. All regions are accessible by vias, however the vias a
re small so it was difficult to solder wires to them. In the future, larger vias
 should probably be used.
